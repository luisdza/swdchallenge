Story Telling with Data

## overview
One of the best ways to learn is to do. The #SWDchallenge is a monthly challenge where you can practice and apply data visualization and storytelling skills. Think of this as a safe space to try something new: test out a new tool, technique, or approach. There’s no obligation—participate in one, a couple, or all.
